# Advent Of Code 2023

## Description
Advent of Code is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

In my case, I just want to practice my Rust skills, which I'm currently learning.

## Running the code

Rust needs to be installed, info [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

#### Running tests

```bash
$ cargo test
```


#### Running each program

```bash
$ cargo run
```
